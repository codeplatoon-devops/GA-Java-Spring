# Simple Java Spring maven workflow assignment

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to create a GitHub Actions workflow for a Java Spring project based on the provided GitHub repository. This assignment will help you test your knowledge and skills in implementing GitHub Actions workflows.

## Steps

1. Fork the provided GitHub repository 
    
    [https://github.com/chandradeoarya/devops-cicd-gaction-java-spring](https://github.com/chandradeoarya/devops-cicd-gaction-java-spring)
    
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch from the main branch, and name it as `github-action`.
4. Create a new file in the root directory of the project called `java.yml` and write the GitHub Actions workflow for the project in this file. The workflow should include the following steps:
    - Checkout the code from the `github-action` branch.
    - Set up the Java environment for the project.
    - Build the project using Maven.
    - [optional] Deploy the project to a remote server using SSH.
5. Commit and push the changes to the `github-action` branch.
6. Create a pull request from the `github-action` branch to the main branch.

## Deliverables

- A GitHub Actions workflow file named `java.yml`.
- A pull request from the `github-action` branch to the main branch.
- Screenshot of the successful run.
- Github repository URL.
